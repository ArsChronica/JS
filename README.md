This shit is my first attempt at making an actual functioning project in JavaScript. It is functional, albeit rudimentary, and could be improved massively.
Firstly it might be improved by not being a spaghetti clusterfuck that is more confusing than a schizophrenic's first attempt at playing Factorio. 
It has been aided partially by AI, not in making it per say, but guiding me what to actually do and what do those funny little symbols arrows do. It did help me with the chart (I copy pasted it).
But most of the code you will bask in the glory was done by yours truly.
